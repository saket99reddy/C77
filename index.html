        to download visual studio code do the following steps.
        <br>
        1.Download the Visual Studio Code installer for Windows.
        <br>
        2.Once it is downloaded, run the installer (VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe). This will only take a minute.
        <br>
        3.By default, VS Code is installed under C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code .
        <br>
        (visual studio is free and can be used without internet.)
        <br>
        once you have done this to set it up you have to create a new file in file exporer then click on file in visual studio code 
        <br>
